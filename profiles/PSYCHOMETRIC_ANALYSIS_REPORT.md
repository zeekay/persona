## Key Findings

### Major OCEAN Adjustments Made

#### Conscientiousness Underestimation
- **Einstein**: Increased from 60 to 75
  - Evidence: Systematic patent work, disciplined physics approach, decades-long persistence on unified field theory
  - Research Support: Conscientiousness correlates with scientific achievement and systematic work habits (Roberts et al., 2007)

#### Agreeableness Underestimation
- **Newton**: Increased from 20 to 35
  - Evidence: Collaborative relationships with Halley, mentorship capacity, professional courtesy when not threatened
  - Research Support: Extremely low agreeableness incompatible with functional professional relationships (Graziano & Eisenberg, 1997)

- **Darwin**: Increased from 65 to 75
  - Evidence: Extensive collaborative correspondence, diplomatic publication approach, concern for others' feelings
  - Research Support: High agreeableness facilitates scientific collaboration and mentorship (Anderson et al., 2008)

#### Neuroticism Adjustments
- **Tesla**: Increased from 55 to 80
  - Evidence: Documented OCD behaviors, severe social anxiety, mental health struggles, sensory sensitivities
  - Research Support: OCD and anxiety disorders strongly correlate with high neuroticism (Kotov et al., 2010)

- **Lincoln**: Increased from 50 to 55
  - Evidence: Documented depression, anxiety about war progress, emotional volatility during personal losses
  - Research Support: Depression and anxiety indicate elevated neuroticism, but functional leadership shows emotional regulation capacity

- **Churchill**: Increased from 55 to 60
  - Evidence: "Black dog" depression periods, emotional volatility, stress-related behaviors
  - Research Support: Bipolar tendencies and depression correlate with elevated neuroticism

#### Extraversion Refinements
- **Shakespeare**: Decreased from 65 to 60
  - Rationale: Limited biographical evidence suggests more observational than participatory social engagement
